On the index page I am displaying all of the posts I have in the table "Posts". But when I display them all, at the end of the last post a text shows up which is wrapped in square brackets and contains all of the information from the table. I just want to know how to remove this text.

For example, I was working on a wedding website, and I found a lot of nice fonts for that subject. But I can''t find the right way to add that font on the server.

Please see example it will make more sense.
If the user selects ''HS2'', I want to create a new input field upon selecting that value. If the user were to select HS2, but change to (for example) HS1, I would want to remove that input field because it should only be present once its selected. This should be in realtime and NOT after the user clicks submit. Here is my current code:
